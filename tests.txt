Do not test with more than 200 philosophers.

Do not test with time_to_die or time_to_eat or time_to_sleep set to values lower than 60 ms.

Examples:

./philo 1 800 200 200	The philosopher should not eat and should die.
./philo 5 800 200 200	No philosopher should die.
./philo 5 800 200 200 7	No philosopher should die and the simulation should stop when every philosopher has eaten at least 7 times.
./philo 4 410 200 200	No philosopher should die.
./philo 4 310 200 100	One philosopher should die.

Test with 2 philosophers and check the different times: a death delayed by more than 10 ms is unacceptable.

./philo 2 800 200 200	No philosopher should die.
./philo 2 401 200 200	No philosopher should die.
./philo 2 400 200 200	One philosopher should die.

Test with any values of your choice to verify all the requirements. 
Ensure philosophers die at the right time, that they don't steal forks, and so forth.





Hard Test:

./philo 3 310 103 103

3 philos, con 310 de muerte, si comen 103 es 103*3 = 309
tiene 1 milisegundo de margen hasta la muerte
